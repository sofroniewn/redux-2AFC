# redux-2AFC

This example implements a two alternative force choice task using [`redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). In the 2AFC task you must click the button with the number corresponding to the target shown within 1 second of the target appearing. If you get the number correct, the correct counter will increment, if you get the number wrong the wrong counter will increment, and if you do not press any button in time the missed counter will increment.

The contents and time of each action and the value of the current state gets logged to the console on each action.
